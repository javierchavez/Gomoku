#Gomoku
---

I created this for UNM CS 251 Lab2

To get the full gaming experience you must run from the terminal.

To compile:

	javac -cp "lab2.jar:." Gomoku.java

To run and play:

	java -cp "lab2.jar:." Gomoku person	
	
To play against the computer:

	java -cp "lab2.jar:." Gomoku computer	
	
If you do not include an arg it assumes you are playing agaist the computer.
